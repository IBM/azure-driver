# Install

Install AZURE Driver using Helm:

```
helm install --name azure-driver azure-driver-0.0.1.tgz
```

Add configuration through a custom Helm values file:

```
touch custom-values.yaml
```

Add configuration to this file (check [Helm Configuration](#helm-configuration) and [Application Configuration)[#app-configuration] for details of the properties that may be configured):

```
app:
  config:
    override:
      messaging:
        connection_address: cp4na-o-events-kafka-bootstrap:9092
```

Reference the values file on install to apply configuration:

```
helm install --name azure-driver azure-driver-0.0.1.tgz -f custom_values.yaml-
```

## Configure driver to resource manager

  ### 1. Configure lmctl
     
  Please refer the document to configure lmctl [LMCTL](https://pages.github.ibm.com/tnc/tnc.github.io/technical/development-environment/openshift-development-environment#lmctl)


  ### 2. Get the cert file from secret

     
    oc get secret azure-driver-tls -o jsonpath="{.data['tls\.crt']}" | base64 -d > azuredriver-tls.pem
    

  ### 3. Delete if the driver already exists.
       
  This step is optional. User can apply this if driver is already onboarded

  
    lmctl resourcedriver delete --type azure <lmctl-env-name>
  

  ### 4. Add AZURE driver to resource manager

    lmctl resourcedriver add --type azure --url https://azure-driver:7275 --certificate azuredriver-tls.pem <lmctl-env-name>
    

  With this, resource manager will know there is a driver of type 'azure' and how it can reach the reach the driver.
